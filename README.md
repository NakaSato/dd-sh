# DD-SH Documentation

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator, and uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the package manager.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed:

```bash
# Install Bun (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Or on macOS with Homebrew
brew install bun
```

## Installation

```bash
bun install
```

## Local Development

```bash
bun start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
bun run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Using SSH:

```bash
USE_SSH=true bun run deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> bun run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Clear Docusaurus cache and build artifacts
bun run clear

# Type checking
bun run typecheck

# Serve production build locally
bun run serve
```
